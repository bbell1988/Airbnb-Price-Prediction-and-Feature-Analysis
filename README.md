## Installation
The libraries used in this study are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and folium. The code should run with no issues using Python 3.
## Project Motivation
In this project, I used a kaggle dataset of Boston Airbnb listings. I was interested in finding answers to the following questions:
1. How do discrete features such as bathroom count affect the total price of an Airbnb listing?
2. Which amenities affect the listing price the most?
3. Which neighbourhood would have the least/most expensive listings?
4. What features adversely predict the price of an Airbnb listing the most?
## File Descriptions
